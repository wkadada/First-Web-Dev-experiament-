			Hi, you made it to my website sample. I recently started some courses on HTML and CSS to expand my skills beyond the programming languages I learned during my academic time at UCSB. I hold a B.S. Statistics and I am eager to launch my career in the tech industry and become an expert on all things Data and Web Development. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I Love the outdoors and meeting new people. Surfing the Santa Barbara waves and hiking its mountains are some of my favorite things to do around town. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Dive into my resume and let's connect!
